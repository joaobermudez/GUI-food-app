# GUI-food-app
"""this app can generate the price of what a customer bought.
It would show the price of the item, some option of the meal or purchase, and other information relating to the customer or purchase.
It would also save the information of the purchase in a text file.
When filling out the entries, only iput the number of items purchased not price.
For example: "Fries input 1" not the price of the meal.
It would calucalte the total cost, with tax included, of the purchase.
There is also some instruction at the buttom right-hand corner on how to input number in the app.
Below is a copy of my code. Thank you."""
